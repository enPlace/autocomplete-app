On active: the text of the input field is equal to the active list item 
the color of the active list item is light blue
if none active, the text of the input field is what the user entered originally

key rules: 
__Key Down__
if none active, first list item is active

if one is active, that item is inactive and the next item is active

if last is active, none active

__Key Up__
none active, last is active 

if one is active that item is inactive and the previous item is active

if first is active, none active 



How to: 
check for active list items: 
    I could loop through all of the list items, or I could just set a variable to the list item, or to its 
        data target. I alraedy have a data-target number for each list, and I could use that to select the item and 
        whatever item I want next. If there is nothing in the variable, I know that none are active 



done for down direction, now I need to set the search value to the active item without losing the original text. 

I also have to think about typing more

so make a variable equal to "". lets say searchValue = ""

on input, searchBar.value = searchValue + input
then searchBar.value = input
